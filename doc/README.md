# copier-dpf-faust

A [copier] project template for DISTRHO Plugin Framework ([DPF]) audio
effect plugins using [FAUST] for the implementation of the DSP pipeline.

## Quickstart

To create a DPF effect plugin using this template, install copier (see
the [installation instructions]) and then run:

```console
$ copier copy gh:SpotlightKid/copier-dpf-faust <path/to/destinmation>
```

and enter the plugin name and other info at the prompts. (See the
[copier documentation] on how to change the default values for these
prompts.)

Here is an example (some output omitted for clarity):

```console
$ copier gh:SpotlightKid/copier-dpf-faust dpffaustgain

Your DPF/FAUST audio effect plugin project is now ready!
To compile it, change into the 'dpffaustgain' directory and type 'make'.
The plugin binaries and LV2 bundle will be placed in the 'bin' subdirectory.
Have fun!
```

A directory named after the second argument you gave to `copier copy` will be
created and initialized as a Git repository and DPF added as a Git submodule.

Enter the directory and run `make`:

```console
$ cd dpffaustgain
$ make
```

The resulting plugin binaries will be placed in the `bin` sub-directory of your
project.

The FAUST DSP implementation will be in in the `faust` sub-directory, in a file
named `<plugin_name>.dsp` (in all lower-case). Adapt it as you see fit and run
`make` again to re-generate the C++ source code from the the FAUST source and
to rebuild the binaries. The second compilation will be much faster, because
the DPF library has already been built.

The static and generated source code for your plugin is in a sub-directory of
the `plugins` directory named after the value you specified for `plugin_name`
(again in all lower-case).

See the `README.md` file in your generated project for more information on
compiling, prerequisites and how to install the finished plugin(s).


## Requirements

To create a project using this cookie cutter template you need:

* Python
* Git
* [copier]

To build the generated project, you need additional development tools. See the
`README.md` file in your generated project for more information.
